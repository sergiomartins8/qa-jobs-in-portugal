## About
Inspired by the COVID-19 tragic events of unemployment arising within my network connections, I decided to develop this open-source project with the goal of supporting those who are tireless looking for a new QA opportunity here, in my beloved Portugal.

Using my automation expertise, every day and automatically, this solution goes through websites that allow organizations to publicly list new opportunities and aggregates them in a simple and smooth list available for everyone who wishes to apply.

That being said, all I ask is that if you have a GitHub account, you star this repository and share it, so we can reach and support as many people as possible!
